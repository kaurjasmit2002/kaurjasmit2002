Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression Classification.Heart disease is a pervasive health issue globally, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Timely prediction and intervention are crucial for reducing the burden of heart disease and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning techniques offer promising tools for heart disease prediction, providing an opportunity to leverage patient data to identify individuals at risk.

In this project, we focus on employing logistic regression, a widely-used classification algorithm, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic features. Logistic regression is particularly well-suited for binary classification tasks, making it an appropriate choice for predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting heart disease and showcase its potential as a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset and building a predictive model, we strive to contribute to the development of accurate and efficient risk assessment strategies for heart disease.
